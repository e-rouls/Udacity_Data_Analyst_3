# Udacity_Data_Analyst_3
Communicate Data Findings - GoBikes

This is the third of three projects completed for Udacity's 
Data Analyst Nanodegree programme. It is not meant to be a 
deep dive into the dataset but an exercise in data 
visualisation and presentation for, uni/bi/multivariate data.

The dataset in question contains data on the usage of Ford
Go-Bikes in the greater San Francisco area.
Although this project is focussed on the visualisations I
first undertook some cleaning and manipulation of the data
in order to make some interesting explorations of the data.

Part 1 covers the cleaning and exploration stage

Part 2 is much shorter and only contains the final
observations with a summary.
